## Brief

 We frequently find ourselves donating to charity , with the expectation that the organization would spend money on our behalf for social welfare. However, ***most of the time, we have no idea where the money is going***. They are obligated to use the funds for our intended purpose. Our approach addresses this issue by increasing the system's transparency.

 People can use the website to contribute money to their preferred charity or to pay their taxes. The money can be collected by the organization. When the organization collects the money, they will be required to provide a reason for doing so. ***The system will then inform contributors about the organization's collection*** by text message. As a result, individuals will know exactly where their money is being spent.

 This brings ***transparency*** to the whole operation. People get to know where their money is going and the charities can give feedback to the people on where they’re spending people’s money. Furthermore, by visiting an organization's page, individuals may check their spending records and reasons. They will be able to view the top contributors, the most recent donations, and other relevant information.
